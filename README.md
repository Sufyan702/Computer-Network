 Small Campus Network – Cisco Packet Tracer

 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple multi-department Small Campus Network using *Cisco Packet Tracer*.  
The network consists of three departments:
-  Admin
-  IT
- Library

Each department contains two PCs connected to a switch, and all switches connect to a central router for communication.

---

 Objectives
- Understand LAN communication and networking basics
- Configure IP addresses on end devices and router interfaces
- Test communication using the *ping* command
- Build and simulate a functional campus network topology

---

Tools & Technologies Used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Cisco Packet Tracer | Network design & simulation |
| Basic Networking Devices | Router, Switches, PCs |

---

 Network Topology
Star-based topology with router as central connectivity device.

Departments & Subnets
| Department | Network Address |
|-----------|----------------|
| Admin | 192.168.10.0/24 |
| IT | 192.168.20.0/24 |
| Library | 192.168.30.0/24 |

 Implementation Summary
- Assigned IPs to each PC with correct gateway
- Configured router interfaces for routing between networks
- Verified connectivity using *ping* tests

---

 Results
✔ All devices successfully communicated  
✔ Network designed, configured & tested without errors  
✔ Demonstrates proper LAN-to-LAN routing

---

  Conclusion
This project improves networking skills including IP addressing, cabling, router configuration, and simulation testing. Future enhancements may include VLANs, DHCP, Wi-Fi access points, and security configurations like ACLs.
